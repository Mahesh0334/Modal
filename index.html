      <p class="color-p">
        Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day,
        Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market
        and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What
        will you give me in return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give
        you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the
        cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said,
        “You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!” She threw the
        beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without
        dinner........
